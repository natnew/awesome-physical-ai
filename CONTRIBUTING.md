# Contributing to Awesome Physical AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list aims to be a high-quality, curated collection of resources for Physical AI and Embodied AI—helping people learn, build, deploy, and stay current in the field.

## Guidelines

### What Makes Something "Awesome"?

Only submit resources that you have personally used or can genuinely recommend. Ask yourself:

- Is this tool/paper/resource actively maintained?
- Does it provide unique value not covered by existing entries?
- Would a robotics researcher or practitioner benefit from knowing about this?
- Is it accessible (good documentation, open-source, or has a public demo)?

### Quality Standards

Resources should meet these criteria:

- **Software/Tools**: Actively maintained (commits within last 12 months), has documentation, and ideally >100 GitHub stars.
- **Papers**: Published at peer-reviewed venues (ICRA, RSS, CoRL, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) or influential arXiv preprints with >50 citations.
- **Hardware**: Commercially available or has open-source designs with reproduction guides.
- **Courses**: From recognized institutions or with substantial community adoption.
- **Companies**: Established organizations with public products, demos, or research output.

### Formatting

Follow these formatting conventions:

```markdown
- [Name](URL) - Description ending with a period.
```

- Use `- ` (dash with space) for list items.
- Descriptions should be concise (one sentence).
- Descriptions start with uppercase, end with period.
- Use proper capitalization: `ROS 2` not `ros2`, `PyTorch` not `pytorch`.
- No trailing slashes on URLs.
- No period after URLs.

### Categories

- Add entries to the most specific applicable category.
- Entries should be alphabetically ordered within their category.
- If a resource fits multiple categories, add it to the primary one only.
- New categories require at least 3 quality entries.
